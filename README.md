C++23 solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 problemset
As of December 1 2023, C++23 has not been fully released, and many features remain under development. Because of the usage of <print> and std::ranges::to, you need a C++23 compiler to run the solutions.
These solutions are not optimized for anything. My goal is to use certain slightly more advanced features to get a feel for how to use them (Ranges, std::optional, etc.).
